# Lending Pool Platform

This project implements a decentralized lending pool system on the Soroban blockchain using Rust and the Soroban SDK. The system allows lenders to contribute to a shared pool, borrowers to request loans, and borrowers to repay loans. The platform calculates the earnings for each lender based on their contribution to the pool.

## Project Setup

To get started with the project, you'll need to have the following installed:
- React (for the frontend application)
- Soroban SDK (for interacting with the smart contract)

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
2. Install dependencies for the frontend:
     npm install

3. Replace contract_address in src/api/contract.js with the deployed contract address on the Soroban blockchain.

4. Start the frontend server:
    npm start

This will run the application on http://localhost:3000.

Smart Contract Overview
The smart contract is implemented in Rust using the Soroban SDK. It handles the core logic of the lending pool, including:

Initializing the pool
Accepting contributions from lenders
Allowing borrowers to request loans
Processing loan repayments
Viewing lender balances and loan statuses

Key Structures
  LoanRequest: Contains information about a loan, including the borrower, principal, interest rate, due date, and repayment status.
  LenderContribution: Stores a lender's contribution to the pool.
  Pool: Tracks the total funds in the pool, lender contributions, and active loans.

Key Functions
  initialize_pool: Initializes a new lending pool.
  contribute_to_pool: Allows lenders to contribute funds to the pool.
  request_loan: Allows borrowers to request a loan, provided there are enough funds in the pool.
  repay_loan: Allows borrowers to repay loans, with a check for total repayment and penalties for late repayment.
  view_lender_balance: Allows a lender to view their contribution balance.
  view_loan_status: Allows a borrower to view the status of their loan.
  calculate_lender_earnings: Calculates the potential earnings for a lender based on the pool's total interest earned.

Frontend Overview
  The frontend is a React application that allows users to interact with the lending pool contract. It consists of the following components:
    Pool: Displays the total funds in the pool and provides an option to initialize the pool.
    Contribution: Allows lenders to contribute funds to the pool.
    LoanRequest: Allows borrowers to request a loan.
    Repayment: Allows borrowers to repay their loans.

Key Files
  public/index.html: The HTML template for the React app.
  src/api/contract.js: Contains the functions that interact with the Soroban smart contract.
  src/components/Pool.js: Displays pool data and initializes the pool.
  src/components/Contribution.js: Handles lender contributions to the pool.
  src/components/LoanRequest.js: Handles loan requests from borrowers.
  src/components/Repayment.js: Handles loan repayments.
  src/App.js: Main app file with routing for different components.
  src/styles.css: Basic CSS styling for the app.

API Overview
  The API functions in src/api/contract.js interact with the Soroban smart contract. The key functions are:
    initializePool: Initializes the lending pool.
    contributeToPool: Allows lenders to contribute funds to the pool.
    requestLoan: Allows borrowers to request a loan.
    repayLoan: Allows borrowers to repay a loan.
    viewLenderBalance: Returns the balance of a lender.
    viewLoanStatus: Returns the status of a borrower's loan.

Running the Project
To run the project locally:

1. Install dependencies:
    npm install

2. Replace the contract_address in src/api/contract.js with the actual deployed contract address.

3. Run the frontend server:
    npm start
4. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 to interact with the lending pool platform.

Testing
For testing the smart contract, create unit tests in the tests folder using Sorobanâ€™s testing framework. You can run the tests with the following command:
  cargo test

For the frontend, you can use Jest or React Testing Library to test components and API functions. Install testing libraries if needed:
  npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react
